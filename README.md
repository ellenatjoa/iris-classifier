# SVM on Iris Dataset
For this project, we have an Iris dataset introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.The Iris dataset contains measurements for 150 Iris flowers from three different species.

The goal of this project is to create a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier model to classify flowers from the Iris dataset into different categories.
